Welcome to the documentation for Chano.
=======================================
Chano is an almost direct port of Djangos Template Language to PHP. But where
Django uses its own template language, Chano is implemented as a PHP iterator
that lets you iterate over an array, stdClass or Iterator and manipulate its
content in a variety of ways, matching the capabilities of the Django Template
Language.

Besides from being able to iterate over data, all the Chano functions can also
be called on non iterable values.

Chano is - thanks to the great Django documentation - pretty well documented.
Learn all about Chano by following the links below or get the code from the
github project at https://github.com/runekaagaard/php-chano and start hacking.
