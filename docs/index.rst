Welcome to the documentation for Chano.
=======================================
This page is a stub.

See documentation on the Django filters here
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/.

Chano is a standard PHP iterator class that accepts an array of things. It lets 
you iterate over it like you would a normal array. 

But instead of just being able to access the raw value it also provides access 
to a large range of utility functions that manipulates or asks questions about 
the value in various ways. The functions provided are almost directly ported 
from the Django Template Language.
